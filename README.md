# SwiftEliza

SwiftEliza is a Swift + iOS implementation of Weizenbaum's [ELIZA chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), which is a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist. 

Based on my [Go implementation](https://github.com/kennysong/goeliza) and QuestionBot from Apple's [App Development with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/book/app-development-with-swift/id1118575552) book.

# Notes

To run, clone this repo and open the `SwiftEliza.xcodeproj` in XCode. 

The functionality of ELIZA is contained in the `Eliza.swift` file, and the others are mostly boilerplate for the iOS app to run.

This was written in Swift 3 and for iOS 10 and above.
